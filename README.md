# California inmates transfers data
This dataset is based on a California Public Records Act request by CalMatters reporter [Byrhonda Lyons](https://calmatters.org/author/byrhonda/) to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

There are two files available:
* **overall_transfers_2016-2021.csv**: Each row contains the number of ```Transfers``` the person with that ```ID``` had in that ```Year```, regardless of the person’s mental health designation.
* **eop_transfers_2016-2021.csv**: Each row contains the number of ```Transfers``` the person with that de-identified ```ID``` had in that ```Year``` while they were in the enhanced mental health program. The number of ```Transfers``` here is a subset of the transfers for that person and year in the first dataset.

## About the data
* The enhanced mental health program (EOP) provides outpatient mental health care for incarcerated people.
* Transfers include moves to county jail for court appearances, out-to-hospital for medical appointments, among other reasons. Each movement represents one transfer. For example, if an incarcerated person is ordered to appear in court and return to the institution, that is counted as two transfers.
* The de-identified ID represents the same person across both datasets.
